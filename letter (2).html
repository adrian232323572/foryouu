    <h2>Dear Lovely,</h2>
    <p>I don’t usually do things like this, but there’s something I want to say and I hope this message reaches you.</p>
    <p>I just want you to know that I truly admire you. There’s something about your smile that I truly love. I admire who you are—the way you look and the way you smile. It’s all effortlessly beautiful.</p>
    <p>We may not have shared deeper conversations, but even in those little messages, I’ve found comfort and warmth. I just wanted to be honest and let you know how I feel. You’re someone truly special, and I wanted you to hear that directly from me.</p>
    <p class="signature">Sincerely,<br/>Adrian</p>
